# scgraphs
A Simple Computational Graph Library in Python

A simple Python computational graph library built on top of numpy. Makes it easy to define and run computational graphs, as well as performing backpropagation to obtain the derivative of a certain scalar variable with respect to any antecesor node in the graph.

Can be used to define and train Machine Learning models as it allows to easily compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to weight matrices and bias vectors.

It's also useful to start getting a feel on how computational graphs work before starting to use more complex and powerful libraries like TensorFlow.

It is meant to stay simple, as it has mainly educational purposes.
